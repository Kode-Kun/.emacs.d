# .emacs.d

My personal Emacs config.
The main config file is config.org, which gets its code blocks loaded into config.el on startup.

I also have my own tiny minor mode in kode-mode.el, which I simply use for overriding keybindings to ones that make more sense to me. There's probably a better way of doing this than creating an entire mode, but this is the first option I found that actually worked.

The packages listed in config.org should be installed through MELPA before the first startup.
